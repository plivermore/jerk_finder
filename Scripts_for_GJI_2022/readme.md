#### Here are the Python notebooks and data files that reproduce the relevant figures from 

Aubert J, Livermore PW, Finlay CC, Fournier A, Gillet N. 2022. A taxonomy of simulated geomagnetic jerks. Geophysical Journal International. 231(1), pp. 650-672  

#### Workflow
1. The script _collect_jerk_histograms.py_ can be run to collect data on the lat/long degree grid. Alternatively, just use the datafiles pre-computed.

2. Run the workbook _Make_figures_for_paper.ipynb_, altering the required jerk number at the start of the notebook.
